Currently, I'm working on my PhD in [Personal Health Informatics](https://phi.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). I'm part of the [Vitek Lab](https://olga-vitek-lab.khoury.northeastern.edu/), where I study statistical analysis of mass spectrometry imaging. 

## Background

Like so many people in research, my background is a chaotic mix of different research experiences. I earned my undergraduate degree in microbiology from the [University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu/) (Class of 2017 go catamounts). At UVM, I had the opportunity to explore the many corners of biology and health. I learned that I prefer the dry lab (not for lack of experience) and enjoy the process of science.


I spent three years working as a research assistant at the [Vermont Center on Behavior and Health](https://www.med.uvm.edu/behaviorandhealth/home) and the [Vermont Child Health Improvment Program](https://www.uvm.edu/larnermed/vchip)  where I worked on projects [characterizing opioid overdoses in Vermont](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-021-06831-4) and [evaluating perinatal healthcare quality](https://www.uvm.edu/larnermed/vchip/perinatal-quality-collaborative-vermont-pqc-vt). I am forever thankful to all of my mentors at UVM; their guidance and support helped shape me into the scientist I am today.

I left Vermont to attend Northeastern's Personal Health Informatics doctoral program. Earlier in the program, I studied the effect of personalized health coaching on physical activity and health outcomes of older adults with Dr. Dinesh John. In 2024, I transitioned to [Dr. Olga Vitek's lab](https://olga-vitek-lab.khoury.northeastern.edu/) where I now work on methods for statistical analysis of mass spectrometry imaging experiments with complex designs.
