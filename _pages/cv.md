## Education

* Currently completing a Ph.D in Personal Health Informatics, Northeastern University
* Bachelor of Science in Microbiology, University of Vermont, 2017

## Experience

* **2024-Current: Graduate Research Assistant**
  * Vitek Lab, Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University
  * My work in the Vitek Lab focuses on creating workflows for statistical analysis of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data - specifically for the analysis of multi-sample MSI experiments with complex designs. I plan to expand this work to inlcude other spatial-omics modalties, as well as new methods of analysis that better integrate spatial information. The overall goal of my work is to promote statistical rigor of spatial-omics experiments by developing, educating other researchers on, and promoting access to high quality, open-source, and user-friendly statical tools for spatial-omics analysis. I also help organize (admin, marketing, web presence, event managment, etc.) the May Institute, a series of short courses on computational biology and proteomics held at Northeastern University.
  * Advisor: Dr. Olga Vitek

* **2021-2023: Graduate Research Assistant** 
  * John Lab, Bouvé College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University
  * Conducting human subjects research on the effect of personalized health coaching on physical activity and other health outcomes in older adults, including recruiting participants, collecting data, creating and maintaing data processing pipelines, statistical analysis of wearable accelerometery data, grant and muscript writing, and attending conferences. Transfered to the Vitek lab when Dr. John left Northeastern University for a postion at NIH.
